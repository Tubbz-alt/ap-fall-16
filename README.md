A collection of the four final projects of the Advanced Programming course of the Computer Science and Networking Master's Degree @ University of Pisa.


The projects 1 and 2 require first to design an abstract model for a Software Defined Network (one switch that communicates with one controller) and then to implement the modules and the communication between them respectively in Ocaml and in Python. More in details:

- <b>project 1</b>:
Consist in the implementation of a Domain Specific Programming Language for a SDN. The main parts are an abstract switch module (capable of receiving, processing and forwarding packets), a controller module (capable of creating and modifying the forwarding table and able to manage security policies) and the design of the interpreter for the control language (implemented in Ocaml). The interaction between the modules is simulated given a set of packets, the network and the interfaces of input and output of the switch abstract module.
